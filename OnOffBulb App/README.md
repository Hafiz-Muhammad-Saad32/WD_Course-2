# 💡 OnOffBulb App

The **OnOffBulb App** is a simple yet visually engaging React project that allows users to toggle a bulb **on and off** with the click of a button. Alongside the functional toggle, the app also features a glowing **radial gradient border effect** to simulate visual feedback.

This is my **second React app**, built to explore React state management, conditional rendering, and dynamic UI styling.
